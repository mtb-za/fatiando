Euler deconvolution with a moving window
----------------------------------------

Euler deconvolution attempts to estimate the coordinates of simple (idealized)
sources from the input potential field data. There is a strong assumption that
the sources have simple geometries, like spheres, vertical pipes, vertical
planes, etc. So it wouldn't be much of a surprise if the solutions aren't great
when sources are complex.

Let's test the Euler deconvolution using a moving window scheme, a very common
approach used in all industry software. This is implemented in
:class:`fatiando.gravmag.euler.EulerDeconvMW`.
